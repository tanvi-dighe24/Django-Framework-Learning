Note: Installation process can be varry as per enviroment, if you faced any issue kindly check proper steps required.

1)Environment Setup:

Purpose: To keep project dependencies isolated and avoid version conflicts.

Commands:

python -m venv venv (Create)

source venv/bin/activate (Mac/Linux) or .\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

2)Django Installation:

Command: pip install django

Verification: python -m django --version

3)Project vs. App:

Project: The overall website configuration and collection of settings.

django-admin startproject config . (The dot keeps the directory structure flat).

App: A specific sub-module or feature within the project.

python manage.py startapp main

4)Database & Server:

Migrate: Sets up default database tables for users and sessions.

python manage.py migrate

Run Server: Starts the local development environment.

python manage.py runserver

Access: View the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

5)Best Practices for GitHub

.gitignore: Crucial to exclude venv/, __pycache__/, and db.sqlite3 from your commits.

Dependencies: Document ur setup for others using pip freeze > requirements.txt.
