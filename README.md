💻Django Documentation By Tanvee Dighe


#Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and scalable web applications. It handles much of the routine hassle of web development, so developers can focus on unique application features. 
Core Principles and Features
Django is known for its "batteries-included" philosophy and adherence to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle. 

#Key features include:
-Object-Relational Mapper (ORM): Allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects and classes instead of writing raw SQL queries.
-Built-in Admin Interface: An automatically generated professional administrative interface for managing website content and data models.
-User Authentication: A full-featured and secure system for handling user accounts, groups, and permissions.

#Security: Built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
-URL Routing: A clean and elegant system for mapping URLs to specific Python functions (views).
-Templating Engine: A powerful template system that separates the front-end (HTML/CSS) from the back-end logic, allowing for dynamic content generation. 

#Architecture (MVT Pattern)
Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is similar to the more widely known Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 
1)Model: Defines the data structure and interacts with the database.
2)View: Contains the business logic, processes the request using models, and decides what data to send to the template.
3)Template: The presentation layer that defines the layout of the web page, combining static HTML with dynamic content. 

#Who Uses Django?
Django's scalability and robustness make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from content management systems (CMS) and e-commerce sites to social networks and scientific computing platforms. 
Well-known sites that use Django include Instagram, Mozilla Firefox, Pinterest, and National Geographic. 
For beginners interested in learning more, the official Django documentation provides excellent tutorials and guides.
