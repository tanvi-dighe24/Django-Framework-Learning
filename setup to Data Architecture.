📊 Django : Models & Databases
1. What is a Model?
A Model is a Python class that defines the structure of your data. It acts as the Single Source of Truth for your information.

Location: myapp/models.py

OR Mapper: Django uses an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) so you can interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL queries.

2. Creating Your First Model
Here is a general example of a Task model.

Python
from django.db import models

class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)  # Text input
    description = models.TextField()           # Large text area
    is_completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

3. The Migration Workflow
Whenever you change models.py, you must follow these two steps to update the database:

Make Migrations: Scans your models and creates a "plan" for the change.

Bash
python manage.py makemigrations
Migrate: Executes the plan and actually updates the database.

Bash
python manage.py migrate
4. The Django Admin (The "Magic" Part)
Django provides a built-in interface to manage your data immediately.

Register the model in myapp/admin.py:

Python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Task

admin.site.register(Task)
Create a Superuser (Admin account):

Bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
Login: Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to see your database table.

5. Summary Checklist for Students
